        <h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Milena. I live in North Carolina, in the city of Charlotte. The mountains here are breathtaking, and the climate is quite pleasant. I used to live in Florida and absolutely loved it, but... let's just say that having summer all year round can make you appreciate the beauty of a cooler breeze! Maybe it's time to embrace the changing seasons and bid farewell to sweating non-stop. Let's just say, I'm enjoying the chance to experience some relief from the scorching heat!</p>
        <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
            <p>My first education was a <em>Master's degree</em> in Psychology (MS in Organizational and Corporate Psychology, diploma with honors with GPA 3.97). But hey, you're not doomed to devote your whole life to something that seemed cool to you at 18, right?</p>
            <p>In my recent roles as a <strong>QA</strong> and <strong>Software Engineer in Test</strong>, I've made it a priority to continuously expand my knowledge and skills. I've taken courses from renowned institutions like the University of Michigan and online platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and Pluralsight, among others. </p>
            <p>From <em>software testing methodologies</em> to the latest advancements in technology, I've eagerly embraced these educational resources to enhance my expertise and stay ahead of the ever-changing software engineering landscape.</p>
            <p>Full list of recently studied courses you can see on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milena-valdes/" title="Milena Valdes LinkedIn" target="_blanc">LinkedIn</a>. </p></h2>

            <p>I enjoy engaging in various active pastimes. My daily routine is enlivened by activities such as yoga, running, tennis, and various forms of fitness. I also have a fondness for active travel, hiking, and snowboarding. However, my ultimate passion lies in playing the violin! I delve into different styles, ranging from classical to contemporary melodies, and I particularly enjoy selecting and performing music from films.
